The split() method in Python is used to split a string into a list of substrings. 

The splitlines() method in Python is used to split a string into a list of lines.
It works by identifying the line boundaries in the string based on the presence of newline (\n), carriage return (\r), or a combination of both (\r\n) characters.

The join() method in Python is used to concatenate a list of strings into a single string, using a specified separator character. 

The partition() method in Python is used to split a string into three parts based on the first occurrence of a specified separator substring. 
The method returns a tuple containing the three parts: the substring before the separator, the separator itself, and the substring after the separator.

The rpartition() method in Python is similar to the partition() method.
But it searches for the last occurrence of a specified separator substring instead of the first occurrence.
