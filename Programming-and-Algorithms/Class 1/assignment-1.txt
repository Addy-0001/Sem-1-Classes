Generally, python is called an interpreter. However, that is not the entire truth. Python is a compiler as well as interpreter. 

Python programs are first compiled and then interpreted. The compilation part is done as we execute the program and then the program is interpreted. 

After compilation, the source code is converted to Byte Code. Then, the byte code gets converted to the python virtual machine (pvm). Byte code is a machine independent code 
which is understood by the virtual machine. A virtual machine is a special software that converts byte code to machine code.

Generation of byte code and running the byte code in a virtual machine makes the interpretation process slower. Therefore, interpretation from say python is generally said 
to be slower than compilation from say the C programming language. 


Write some code as well.  While making the block diagram, Enclose the compiler and Virtual machine in a block.
