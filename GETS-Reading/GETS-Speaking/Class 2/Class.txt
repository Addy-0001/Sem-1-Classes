In both the photos, we can observe two pictures of different restraunts. 
We can see that both the restraunts are crowded. 
The restraunt depicted in the first picture looks to be some kind of an asian restraunt. 
On the other hand, the second picture depicts a western style restraunt. 
The restraunt in the first picture looks more crowded than the one in the second picture.
