The images show the current and projected structures of the SouthWest Airport. 

In the present, we can see that the airport has departures on the left side of the building. 
There is a Cafe in the rightmost side of the departures section close to the security and 
passport control unit. The check in booth can be found in the left side of the departures section. 
The arrival section is on the right side of the airport and has no ameneties as there are on the departures
section. We can also see that the airport has a single walkway and eight gates present. 

The plan shows a lot of proposed developments that will be available next year. First of all, the 
number of gates will be increased from eight to eighteen. And the airport will have an in-house sky train. 
The proposed structure also shows a lot more ameneties in both the arrivals and departures section including
a cafe on both sides, an ATM and a car hire on the arrival section of the airport. The gates leading in and 
out of the airport have also doubled compared to the current plan.
